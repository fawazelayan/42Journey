The makefiles from RANK02 and above will look the same, comments here look awful, tho they look good on VS Code, so the appearance of the makefiles is best on VS Code.


Most projects will be edited later to include READ.md files in them explaining them and putting resources from where and what to study.

Projects will also get polished from time to time by making the appearance better for every makefile and headers, also if there are any unecessary stuff in the code it will be deleted to make the code more efficient and readable.
